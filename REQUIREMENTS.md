# Smart Contract Fuzz-Testing Tool - Requirements & Vision

## Original Vision (User's Initial Query)

Build a smart fuzz-testing tool for analyzing smart contracts, specifically focused on signature testing that can be expanded to other types of testing.

### Core Requirements:
- **Language**: Built with Go
- **Testing Scope**: Both logic AND execution testing
- **Network**: Launch and connect to a private network
- **AI Integration**: Connect to AI tools (ChatGPT with API key)
- **Analysis**: Query AI for analysis of entry points for testing
- **Smart Detection**: AI-assisted finding of timestamp/nonce or any type of data

### Testing Capabilities:
#### Logic Testing:
- Missing protections (nonce, timestamp)
- Structural vulnerabilities
- Signature scheme analysis

#### Execution Testing:
- Execute signatures twice (replay attacks)
- Fuzz testing with malformed data
- Actual contract interaction and validation

## Current Implementation State

### What Exists:
- **Metadata Parser** (`main.go`): Analyzes JSON metadata files
- **Structure Validation**: Checks for missing nonce, timestamp, deadline fields
- **Signature Type Detection**: EIP712, ETH_SIGN, EIP191, CUSTOM
- **Basic JSON Schema**: For describing signature functions

### What's Missing (Major Gaps):

#### 1. Infrastructure & Setup
- [ ] Go module initialization (`go.mod`)
- [ ] Dependency management
- [ ] Project structure and organization

#### 2. Private Network Integration
- [ ] Ganache/geth private network launcher
- [ ] Network configuration management
- [ ] Connection handling and health checks

#### 3. AI Integration Layer
- [ ] ChatGPT API client integration
- [ ] Contract analysis prompts (see `ai_query.txt`)
- [ ] AI-assisted entry point identification
- [ ] Smart data field detection (nonce, timestamp, etc.)

#### 4. Contract Analysis Engine
- [ ] Solidity contract parser
- [ ] Function signature extraction
- [ ] Signature verification logic identification
- [ ] Metadata generation from actual contracts

#### 5. Fuzz Testing Engine
- [ ] Test case generation
- [ ] Malformed signature creation
- [ ] Replay attack simulation
- [ ] Mutation strategies for v/r/s values

#### 6. Execution Engine
- [ ] Contract deployment
- [ ] Transaction execution
- [ ] Result validation
- [ ] Error handling and reporting

#### 7. Test Orchestration
- [ ] Test plan generation
- [ ] Execution coordination
- [ ] Result aggregation
- [ ] Vulnerability reporting

### Key Dependencies Needed:
- `github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum` - Ethereum client
- `github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai` - ChatGPT API
- `github.com/spf13/cobra` - CLI framework
- `github.com/spf13/viper` - Configuration management

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Initialize Go module and project structure
2. Set up basic CLI framework
3. Implement configuration management

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
1. Private network launcher
2. AI integration layer
3. Basic contract parser

### Phase 3: Analysis Engine
1. Signature function detection
2. Metadata generation from contracts
3. AI-assisted vulnerability identification

### Phase 4: Testing Engine
1. Fuzz test generation
2. Execution engine
3. Result validation

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish
1. End-to-end testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Documentation and examples

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements:
- [ ] Can analyze real Solidity contracts (not just JSON metadata)
- [ ] Launches private network automatically
- [ ] Uses AI to identify signature functions and vulnerabilities
- [ ] Generates and executes fuzz tests
- [ ] Detects replay attacks and missing protections
- [ ] Provides actionable security reports

### Technical Requirements:
- [ ] Go-based implementation
- [ ] Modular, extensible architecture
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Configurable testing strategies
- [ ] Performance suitable for large contracts

## Notes for Implementation

### Current Files Analysis:
- `main.go`: Basic metadata parser (needs expansion)
- `example_metadata.json`: Sample data (needs real contract parsing)
- `ai_query.txt`: AI prompt template (needs integration)
- `agent_readme.md`: Current scope documentation

### Integration Points:
- Use `ai_query.txt` as template for contract analysis prompts
- Extend `main.go` structure for actual contract processing
- Build upon existing metadata schema for comprehensive analysis

## Future Expansion Areas

### Additional Testing Types:
- Reentrancy detection
- Access control testing
- Gas optimization analysis
- Upgrade pattern validation

### Enhanced AI Capabilities:
- Natural language vulnerability descriptions
- Automated fix suggestions
- Risk scoring and prioritization
- Historical vulnerability pattern matching
